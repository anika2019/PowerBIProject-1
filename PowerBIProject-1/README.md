Key Learning From This Project :

In this project , I do have financial details for a product with customer and other demographic information. I need to create 1) Finance View 2) Sales View and 3) Market View as required.

Key Learning (in terms of BI Tools) :

1.	Creating static table containing product (financial parameters like net sales, gross margin etc.) and its serial number, then dynamically updating given values according to its serial number (using IF condition).

2.	dynamically changing column headers and any heading (based on selection- USE of selected value)

3.	use of line graph, table, matrix, donuts chart, clustered bar chart and filters.

4.	use of dynamic filter. (display the values for a certain filter value ... for exa. I want to show only those values that are above or below 0.10 )

5.	Use of tool tips.
